The game is played on a 6X6 board where the player's objective is to make a sequence of four characters of X or O horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The major change comes in the switch button where the player swaps their symbols with their opponent which can change the flow of the game entirely. On swapping the player lose their current move and their opponent gets to play again.
